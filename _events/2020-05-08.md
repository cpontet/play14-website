Welcome to Stuttgart and welcome to our first #play14 unconference in Baden-Württemberg!

#play14 is an informal, serious games gathering following Open Space unconference format. Together we will try out different games, tools and playful methods, which can be used in trainings, workshops, during coaching sessions or even for bringing teams together.

This is your opportunity of giving a try to those approaches you always wanted to test out, and where you were not so sure they will work out. You will meet like-minded people, interested in playing together and trying out new things. It is a chance to network and to learn from each other.

Looking forward to play with you :o)
