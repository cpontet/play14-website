## #play14 with families

Since the beginning of #play14, we have had this idea that playing with spouses and kids would be great. So, for the 7th #play14 in Luxembourg, we have decided to make it happen.

We are happy to announce that **#play14 Luxembourg 2020** will be the first ever edition **open to the whole family**.

We still need to figure out some details in order to make this work, but we intend to do it. We will keep you posted on the details.

## How to get there?
