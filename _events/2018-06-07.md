## How to get there

Please visit the [Nokia Paris-Saclay website](http://nokia-on-site.apotest.com/en/paris-saclay)

By plane :
Paris Charles de Gaulle Airport (North of Paris) or Paris Orly Airport (South of
Paris).
Then you can take RER B, regional train, to Massy-Palaiseau. Be careful: RER are
not omnibus. Check on the timetable that your station his highlighted before on-
boarding.
[RER B Time table link](https://www.transilien.com/)

WARNING : There is a strike of SNCF French national railway company, which
includes RER, on June 7 th and 8 th . Some trains will be suppressed. You can check the
list of actually running trains from June 5 th at https://www.sncf.com/fr. To optimize
your travel duration, it could be better to get out of your RER in Paris, and to wait for another RER to Massy. Changing at station “Saint Michel Notre Dame” station offers
double possibilities to join Massy, either by RER B or by RER C.

By national or international train:
WARNING There is a strike of SNCF, French national railway company on June 7 th
and 8 th . Prefer other companies when possible. If you have the choice to arrive at Paris
or at Massy, privilege Massy, which is a lot nearer of #play14 event.

By car:
o GPS COORDINATES
Longitude : 02’ 14’’ 1100 East
Latitude : 48’ 40’’ 0400 North

Recommandations, to take into account additional traffic jam that train strike will
generate:
o From East of Paris: Your GPS will probably propose A86 (small ringroad
around Paris). To avoid traffic jam, prefer N104 (large ringroad around Paris,
called “Francilienne”).
o From West of Paris: N118 which naturally continues as N104
o From South of Paris: You will not have any traffic jam due to the train strike.
o From North of Paris: There is no magic, you will have traffic jam!

From Massy-Palaiseau to Nozay
 By taxi : You can take a taxi from the airport, but it is not going to be cheap.
 By bus, Massy-Palaiseau RER &lt;-&gt; #play 14:
o The bus company is called “Daniel Meyer”
o The bus ID is “DM11C”
o The bus stop is “NOZAY Villarceaux”

Special #play14 Shuttle Nokia &lt;-&gt; Massy-Palaiseau:
We offer a “special #play14 shuttle” to travel between Massy and Nokia-Nozay when
there is no longer any regular bus.
