## Important

Due to some unforeseen events, **we have changed location**.  
#play14 Netherlands will now be hosted by **Xebia in Amsterdam**.

## Thursday evening

We will have a **get together** event on Thusday evening.
However, it will not be at Xebia.

We will communicate where we plan to have this event as soon as we secure a location.
But chill out. Food and drinks will be sponsored by The Future Group.
