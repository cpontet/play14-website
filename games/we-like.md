## The Debriefing Cube

The most important part of a game, except the fun of playing, is the debrief. Unfortunately, most of the time facilitators are not so great at debriefing the game they proposed.

The [Debriefing Cube](http://thedebriefingcube.com/) will help you improve your debriefs by using the six lenses
* Goal
* Process
* Group dynamics
* Communication
* Emotions
* Take-away
