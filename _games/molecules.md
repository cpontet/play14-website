## The game

- The facilitator shouts a number between 2 and 10, depending on the size of the whole group
- People have to form clusters with the exact number of people that was announced
- The molecule should be consistent, so arms should be joined strongly
- Anyone who is not in a molecule is eliminated
- If the group is small, don't eliminate people and just stop when you want
