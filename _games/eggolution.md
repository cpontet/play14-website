Setup

Have people mix together.

 

How to play

All people start as eggs. An egg hits its head shouting ‚Äúegg, egg, egg, egg‚Ä¶‚Äù

When a egg meet an egg, they play rock, paper, scissors.

The winner becomes a chicken. A chicken makes chicken noises while flapping its wings.

When a chicken meets a chicken, they play rock, paper, scissors.

The winner becomes an elephant (because it‚Äôs the next logical thing). An elephant trumpets while moving its trunk.

When an elephant meets an elephant, they play rock, paper, scissors.

The winner becomes superman. Superman circles the group, flying wit his arm in the air.

At the end of the game, will be left

one egg
one chicken
one elephant
and many supermen
